Nearly every part of the tree is said to have a use or value, and older trees are typically only harvested for wood after they have passed their time of fruit-bearing\u2014usually after 50-70 years. Technically neither a softwood nor a hardwood, palm falls into the category of monocots, which also includes bamboo, grass, banana, rice, wheat, corn, etc. (Monocot is short for monocotyledon, which simply means that the seed of the plant contains one leaf, rather than two as found in dicots.) Palm woods have no growth rings, and as a result, the shrinkage rate for drying the wood is more or less uniform between the radial and tangential surfaces, resulting in a T/R ratio of 1.0 and good dimensional stability. Red Palm is highly variable in weight, strength, and hardness properties because the wood is so non-homogenous: the trunk is a gradient between the strong fibrovascular bundles, and the softer cellulose structure. Toward the outer wall of the trunk, the density of the wood is the greatest, and gradually becomes lighter, softer, and weaker towards the soft core. Because of this great variability, the density of Red Palm can range from less than 25 lbs/ft 3 (400 kg/m 3 ), to nearly 62 lbs/ft 3 (1000 kg/m 3 ).

Neville wrote of the wood\u2019s exploitation in his 1919 work, Hardwoods of Cuba : For domestic purposes, the Mahogany is used in such freedom that it seems sacrilege to the newcomer from the North, who has known this wood only in its finished and very expensive forms. Many hundreds of cords of this timber, ranging from 12 inches in diameter down, are annually burned under the boilers of our sugar mills and locomotives: hundreds of trees of the proper sizes are annually cut down and rough-hewed into railroad ties; and for posts, corralled fences, and the myriad other uses of the plantation, Mahogany is utilized. There will come a day not very far distant when the waste of this valuable timber will be regretted. In 1946, Cuban banned all exporting of the wood due to over-harvesting and high demand; it has also been in scarce supply from other sources in the Caribbean as well. Today, the lumber has become so obscure that the term \u201cGenuine Mahogany\u201d now applies almost exclusively to its close substitute, Honduran Mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), rather than the Cuban wood that for centuries has simply been referred to as \u201cMahogany.\u201d Cuban Mahogany\u2019s easy workability, combined with its beauty and phenomenal stability have made this lumber an enduring favorite.", "text_toxicity": "Although severe reactions are quite uncommon, Cuban Mahogany has been reported as a skin irritant.

Unlike trees, bamboo grows\u00a0initially\u00a0at full width, with no tapering or horizontal growth. Some species can grow up to three feet a day! After just one year, bamboo reaches its full height, and in subsequent years, the stem (called the \u201cculm\u201d) continues to harden. The strength of the bamboo continues to increase for the next two to four years; most species of bamboo are considered fully mature in just two to three years. After this time, fungus and mold begin to cover the outside of the culm, eventually working its way into the interior, weakening the plant over several years before it eventually\u00a0collapses from decay. For this reason, there is a window of time when it is considered best to harvest bamboo for optimum\u00a0strength\u00a0and hardness. Bamboo is known to have a high shrinkage rate when\u00a0initially\u00a0being dried, amounting \u00a0to 10-16% in culm diameter and 15-17% in overall wall thickness. Bamboo tends to shrink more towards the outer wall than at the interior: for this reason, surface checks can develop on the outside of the culm if it is dried too rapidly. However, despite the high shrinkage rates for bamboo, once it has adjusted to equilibrium moisture content, it is somewhat stable in use. Although many prefer the\u00a0aesthetics\u00a0of bamboo for its unique, down-to-earth, Asian-flair, the real story on bamboo lies in its mechanical properties. Although it is hard to typify a group of over one thousand different species into a single set of mechanical values, on the whole, bamboo possess some of the best stiffness/strength\u00a0characteristics, and strength-to-weight ratios of any woody material on the planet. But the difficulty in qualifying bamboo\u2019s\u00a0strength lies not only in the abundance of species, but also in the lack of standardized testing: a complicating factor is that bamboo itself tends to be harder and stronger toward the outside of the culm, gradually getting softer and weaker toward the center. In some testing, certain species of bamboo at certain areas of the culm have\u00a0exhibited stiffness ( m.o.e. )\u00a0and bending ( m.o.r. ) values far exceeding that of any hardwood. The only \u201cweakness\u201d of bamboo is simply inconsistency: with so many different species, and so many ways to cut and process bamboo, it is hard to be assured of the mechanical\u00a0characteristics\u00a0of any given bamboo product.", "text_toxicity": "Although severe reactions are quite uncommon, bamboo has been reported to cause\u00a0skin irritation.

Many hundreds of cords of this timber, ranging from 12 inches in diameter down, are annually burned under the boilers of our sugar mills and locomotives: hundreds of trees of the proper sizes are annually cut down and rough-hewed into railroad ties; and for posts, corralled fences, and the myriad other uses of the plantation, Mahogany is utilized. There will come a day not very far distant when the waste of this valuable timber will be regretted. In 1946, Cuban banned all exporting of the wood due to over-harvesting and high demand; it has also been in scarce supply from other sources in the Caribbean as well. Today, the lumber has become so obscure that the term \u201cGenuine Mahogany\u201d now applies almost exclusively to its close substitute, Honduran Mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), rather than the Cuban wood that for centuries has simply been referred to as \u201cMahogany.\u201d Cuban Mahogany\u2019s easy workability, combined with its beauty and phenomenal stability have made this lumber an enduring favorite.", "text_toxicity": "Although severe reactions are quite uncommon, Cuban Mahogany has been reported as a skin irritant.

Unlike trees, bamboo grows\u00a0initially\u00a0at full width, with no tapering or horizontal growth. Some species can grow up to three feet a day! After just one year, bamboo reaches its full height, and in subsequent years, the stem (called the \u201cculm\u201d) continues to harden. The strength of the bamboo continues to increase for the next two to four years; most species of bamboo are considered fully mature in just two to three years. After this time, fungus and mold begin to cover the outside of the culm, eventually working its way into the interior, weakening the plant over several years before it eventually\u00a0collapses from decay. For this reason, there is a window of time when it is considered best to harvest bamboo for optimum\u00a0strength\u00a0and hardness. Bamboo is known to have a high shrinkage rate when\u00a0initially\u00a0being dried, amounting \u00a0to 10-16% in culm diameter and 15-17% in overall wall thickness. Bamboo tends to shrink more towards the outer wall than at the interior: for this reason, surface checks can develop on the outside of the culm if it is dried too rapidly. However, despite the high shrinkage rates for bamboo, once it has adjusted to equilibrium moisture content, it is somewhat stable in use. Although many prefer the\u00a0aesthetics\u00a0of bamboo for its unique, down-to-earth, Asian-flair, the real story on bamboo lies in its mechanical properties. Although it is hard to typify a group of over one thousand different species into a single set of mechanical values, on the whole, bamboo possess some of the best stiffness/strength\u00a0characteristics, and strength-to-weight ratios of any woody material on the planet. But the difficulty in qualifying bamboo\u2019s\u00a0strength lies not only in the abundance of species, but also in the lack of standardized testing: a complicating factor is that bamboo itself tends to be harder and stronger toward the outside of the culm, gradually getting softer and weaker toward the center. In some testing, certain species of bamboo at certain areas of the culm have\u00a0exhibited stiffness ( m.o.e. )\u00a0and bending ( m.o.r. ) values far exceeding that of any hardwood. The only \u201cweakness\u201d of bamboo is simply inconsistency: with so many different species, and so many ways to cut and process bamboo, it is hard to be assured of the mechanical\u00a0characteristics\u00a0of any given bamboo product.", "text_toxicity": "Although severe reactions are quite uncommon, bamboo has been reported to cause\u00a0skin irritation.
